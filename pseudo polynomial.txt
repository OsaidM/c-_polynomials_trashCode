- how to read a line

- how to cut the string before the + to extract the coefficient and the exponent
- 	exponent after the ^ sign
	coefficient before the x sign

after extracting we need to add them as pairs in a new array
================
Extraction
================
initialize new array contains pairs of [[coefficient, exponent], [coefficient, exponent]]
extracting coefficient =>
	- we split the first part of the string
	- anything before the X means its the coefficient
	- if there is no X means there is no exponent and we save the coefficient with exponent 0
	- if there is X we search for ^ sign
	- if there is ^ sign we take the number after it
	- if there is no ^ sign means the exponent is 1
	- if there is then we take it
	- if there is X only we search for ^ sign if its there we take exponent
	else 
		- if there is X Only means the coefficient 1 and we take exponent of 1 => irregular
	- 

result1 = [[coefficient, exponent]] ==> polynomial1
result2 = [[coefficient, exponent]] ==> polynomial2
resultAddition[] = new int();

Addition
================

if(result1[0][1] == result2[0][1]){
	resultAddition[0][0] = result1[0][0] + result2[0][0]
	resultAddition[0][1] = result1[0][1]
}
else if (result1[0][1] != result2[0][1]){
	resultAddition[0][0] = result2[0][0];
	resultAddition[0][1] = result2[0][1];
}
